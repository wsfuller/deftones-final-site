              Deftones is an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California,
              U.S. Formed in 1988, the band was founded by Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar),
              Stephen Carpenter (lead guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums) and Dominic Garcia (bass).
              During the group's first five years, the band's lineup changed several times,
              but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined the group after his departure
              in 1990; by this time, Chi Cheng was the band's bassist. The lineup remained
              stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist
              Frank Delgado being added in 1999. The band is known as one of the most
              experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal music scene.
              They are sometimes dubbed "the Radiohead of metal" by critics.

              Deftones have released eight albums since their inception. After the
              lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with
              Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album, Adrenaline,
              in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands
              in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through
              word of mouth. Their sophomore album, Around the Fur, was released
              in 1997. The album and its singles reached chart positions, and the
              album was the band's first to receive certification from the RIAA.
              The band found even further success with their third album, White Pony,
              in 2000. It showed a transition away from the band's earlier sound
              into a more experimental direction. Its lead single, "Change (In the House of Flies)",
              is the group's most commercially successful single, and the album
              track "Elite" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. White
              Pony was the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum
              in the United States.
